# Pawsltd.

## Introduction
We propose to create a mini-amazon for our friends with paws - cats and dogs. The online shopping site will tailor products for pets. The products will have two categories and each category will have four subcategories as illustrated above. As pets have become more and more important members of human lives, we have seen an increase in demand for pet products and thus create a business opportunity for e-commerce that specializes in selling pet products. We hope our final product will be a convenient stop for pet owners to shop and explore for their loved ones.
